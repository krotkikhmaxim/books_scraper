Yet today there is only oneâ\x80\x94homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem. ...more\n', 'rating': 'Five', 'availability': 'In stock (20 available)', 'category': 'History', 'product_info': {'UPC': '4165285e1663650f', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£54.23', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£54.23', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (20 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/ce/5f/ce5f052c65cc963cf4422be096e915c9.jpg'})

I couldn\'t put it down."---Ruth Buzzi, Golden Globe Award winner and Television Hall of Fame inductee"Sadly, too many Americans have never heard of Victoria Woodhull, let alone learned of her story: her revolutionary campaign for the presidency at a time when women weren\'t even allowed to vote, her support for worker\'s rights, or her feminist commitment to equality, a century before the official battle over the Equal Rights Amendment. But in The Coming Woman, Karen Hicks brings Woodhull\'s efforts to life, and reminds us that some of our nation\'s greatest figures aren\'t always featured in the history books. It is a riveting account of an amazing woman and her struggle for justice and human dignity, told in an engaging and eminently readable style."-Tim Wise, author, "White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son""The Coming Woman" is a novel based on the life of feminist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for U.S. President, 50 years before women could even vote!Running for President wasn\'t Victoria\'s only first as a woman. She was also the first to own a successful Wall Street firm, the first to publish a successful national newspaper, and the first to head the two-million-member Spiritualist Association. She was the first woman to enter the Senate Judiciary Committee chambers to petition for woman\'s suffrage, her argument changing the entire focus of the suffragist movement by pointing out that the 14th and 15th Amendments already gave women the vote.In her campaign for the Presidency, Victoria Woodhull boldly addressed many of the issues we still face today: equal pay for equal work; freedom in love; corporate greed and political corruption fueled by powerful lobbyists; and the increasing disparity between the rich and the poor, to name only a few. Her outspoken and common-sense ideas may shed a new perspective on the parallel conundrums of today\'s world.This bold, beautiful, and sexually progressive woman dared to take on society and religion. To make an example of the hypocrisy in what Mark Twain dubbed The Gilded Age, she exposed the extramarital affairs of the most popular religious figure of the day (Henry Ward Beecher). This led to her persecution and imprisonment and the longest, most infamous trial of the 19th century. But it did not stop her fight for equality.Victoria\'s epic story, set in the late 1800s, comes to life in a modern, fictional style, while staying true to the actual words and views of the many well-known characters. ...more\n', 'rating': 'Three', 'availability': 'In stock (19 available)', 'category': 'Default', 'product_info': {'UPC': 'e72a5dfc7e9267b2', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£17.93', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£17.93', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (19 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/97/36/9736132a43b8e6e3989932218ef309ed.jpg'})

We enter the air-conditioned vault deep beneath Capitol Hill where the worldâ\x80\x99s largest collection of First Folios is stored; discover the shadowy history of Joseph Goebbelsâ\x80\x99s obsession with Shakespeare; and uncover the true story behind the scuffed edition in which Nelson Mandela and fellow Robben Island prisoners inscribed their names. Both cultural history and literary travelogue, Worlds Elsewhere is an attempt to understand how Shakespeare has become the international phenomenon he is â\x80\x93 and why."There were very few pages on which I didnâ\x80\x99t learn something new or revelatory. A must-read for anyone interested in Shakespeareâ\x80\x99s impact on people and politics around the globe" (James Shapiro, author of 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare)"Immensely well-informed and highly readable. A revelatory journey of cultural exploration" (Professor Stanley Wells, General Editor of the Oxford and Penguin Shakespeares)"Brilliantly original. Absolutely engaging, witty and irresistible. Whatâ\x80\x99s most remarkable: heâ\x80\x99s said something new about Shakespeare" (Michael Pye, author of The Edge of the World)"A truly original book about Shakespeare: one that explores the dramatist\'s global reach with tenacity, devotion and an exhilarating spirit of adventure" (Michael Billington) ...more\n', 'rating': 'Five', 'availability': 'In stock (18 available)', 'category': 'Nonfiction', 'product_info': {'UPC': '4c28def39d850cdf', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£40.30', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£40.30', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (18 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/7b/d9/7bd93db091d736d0c6ff9d578e3ba3d7.jpg'})

Over time, eight key technologies gradually freed us from the limitations of our animal origins.The fabrication of weapons, the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing and shelter radically restructured the human body, enabling us to walk upright, shed our body hair, and migrate out of tropical Africa. Symbolic communication transformed human evolution from a slow biological process into a fast cultural process. The invention of agriculture revolutionized the relationship between humanity and the environment, and the technologies of interaction led to the birth of civilization. Precision machinery spawned the industrial revolution and the rise of nation-states; and in the next metamorphosis, digital technologies may well unite all of humanity for the benefit of future generations.Synthesizing the findings of primatology, paleontology, archeology, history, and anthropology, Richard Currier reinterprets and retells the modern narrative of human evolution that began with the discovery of Lucy and other Australopithecus fossils. But the same forces that allowed us to integrate technology into every aspect of our daily lives have also brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe.

Digital technology was supposed to usher in a new age of endless prosperity, but so far it has been used to put industrial capitalism on steroids, making it harder for people and businesses to keep up. Social networks surrender their original missions to more immediately profitable data mining, while brokerage houses abandon value investing for algorithms that drain markets and our 401ks alike--all tactics driven by the need to stoke growth by any means necessary. Instead of taking this opportunity to reprogram our economy for sustainability, we have doubled down on growth as its core command. We have reached the limits of this approach. We must escape the growth trap, once and for all.Â\xa0Media scholar and technology author Douglas Rushkoff--one of today's most original and influential thinkers--argues for a new economic program that utilizes the unique distributive power of the internet while breaking free of the winner-take-all system the growth trap leaves in its wake. Drawing on sources both contemporary and historical, Rushkoff pioneers a new understanding of the old economic paradigm, from central currency to debt to corporations and labor.Most importantly, he offers a series of practical steps for businesses, consumers, investors, and policymakers to remake the economic operating system from the inside out--and prosper along the way. Instead of boycotting Wal-Mart or overtaxing the wealthy, we simply implement strategies that foster the creation of value by stakeholders other than just ourselves. From our currency to our labor to the corporation, every aspect of the economy can be reprogrammed with minimal disruption to create a more equitably distributed prosperity for all.Inspiring and challenging, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus provides a pragmatic, optimistic, and human-centered model for economic progress in the digital age. ...more\n", 'rating': 'Three', 'availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'category': 'Nonfiction', 'product_info': {'UPC': '7858914fad68493c', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£31.12', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£31.12', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/f4/21/f4210912ca58ef35f8ad120fe3dfed38.jpg'})

They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother Dorothy, so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in ICU, it falls to Andrea to not only investigate who would want to kill her father and uncle, but also to oversee Harding Industries, the family company. When her fatherâ\x80\x99s longtime attorney and one of a handful of family friends, Beth Cowling, rushes to help Andrea long distance, the youngest Harding soon finds herself surrounded by a bevy of intriguing new friends and helpers. First to arrive is Bethâ\x80\x99s own daughter, Riva, acting as Andreaâ\x80\x99s attorney after Andrea is violently attacked in her fatherâ\x80\x99s home, where she grew up, forcing her to kill both would-be assassins. When Nicholasâ\x80\x99s on again/off again lover, state prosecutor and gubernatorial hopeful Kerry Marcus, is equally at a loss to name suspects in the Harding family attacks, Riva begins her own investigation into the short list of family friends and colleagues, including Don Marshall, former colleague of Nicholasâ\x80\x99s at Marshall Pharmaceutical, which Don now runs, and Donâ\x80\x99s wife Karen. Marshall has a shady past, including an incident at his company that also involved Andreaâ\x80\x99s father. She also looks closely at Marcus Ricci, father of Andreaâ\x80\x99s closest high school friend, Jason. After Jasonâ\x80\x99s death from leukemia, Ricci becomes like a second father to Andrea. Ricci is also widely believed to have ties to the New Jersey mob. But Beth has another contact she wants involved in the investigation, Deirdre Southington, daughter of Bethâ\x80\x99s old friend Cordelia Southington. The Southington family has more money than God, as well as, through Deirdre, more contacts in the intriguing world of international espionage. A former NSA agent, Deirdre is mysterious and beautiful in a cold way. An eccentric who travels via private rail car, she is also extraordinarily persuasive, holding a PhD in forensic psychology that she has put to great use in both her work with the NSA and on her own, as a defender of good, rooting out evil doers and ensuring they are brought to her own brand of justice. Andrea, Riva, and Deirdre all also cast a suspicious eye on the Oakes brothers, Carlton and Jefferson, who run Oakes Industries along with their silent partner and cousin, New Jersey state senator Schuyler Colfax, who also has his eye on the governorâ\x80\x99s seat. Oakes Industries has recently made an attempt to purchase Harding Industries, a seemingly irrational move that is rebuffed by Nicholas. What no one knows until much later is that the Oakes brothers have entered into a business deal with Russian mobster Viktor Roman, who represents the real party interested in acquiring Harding Industries, a Vor, Russian organized crime unit, with heavy international interests in the energy sector. Andrea matures quickly as she rapidly learns who she can and cannot trust during her search for the people out to kill her family. Along with her new friends and advocates, she discovers Harding Industries holds a soon to expire option to buy property that could become the source of untold billions from oil reserves, and moves in the nick of time to exercise their right to purchase. But the biggest blow for the Harding family is yet to comeâ\x80\x94the discovery that Viktor Roman has promised Kerry Marcus the governorâ\x80\x99s seat in exchange for information about the Hardings, including Nicholas and Michaelâ\x80\x99s whereabouts on the night they are shot. Ultimately, Andrea chooses to forego law school and becomes her fatherâ\x80\x99s new partner in Harding Industries, no doubt with many adventures yet to come. Masterfully told using a smattering of historical facts along with a soundtrack of classical music masterpieces, this thriller keeps readers on edge until the very end. ...more\n', 'rating': 'One', 'availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'category': 'Add a comment', 'product_info': {'UPC': '4eed62cf5f8d8edf', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£19.09', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£19.09', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/c7/26/c7260547c468dbe78af92cf3927c2a1c.jpg'})

Within a matter of h Renowned ornithologist Tim Birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches, already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary. As she grows into adulthood, only a few of her eggs mature, are released into the oviduct, and are fertilized by sperm stored from copulation that took place days or weeks earlier. Within a matter of hours, the fragile yolk is surrounded by albumen and the whole is gradually encased within a turquoise jewel of a shell. Soon afterward the fully formed egg is expelled onto a bare rocky ledge, where it will be incubated for four weeks before another chick emerges and the life cycle begins again. A Bird's Egg is about how eggs in general are made, fertilized, developed, and hatched. The eggs of most birds spend just 24 hours in the oviduct; however, that journey takes 48 hours in cuckoos, which surreptitiously lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. From the earliest times, the study of birds' ovaries and ova (eggs) played a vital role in the quest to unravel the mysteries of fertilization and embryo development in humans. Birkhead uses birds' eggs as wondrous portals into natural history, enlivened by the stories of naturalists and scientists, including Birkhead and his students, whose discoveries have advanced current scientific knowledge of reproduction. ...more\n", 'rating': 'Four', 'availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'category': 'Science', 'product_info': {'UPC': 'aadee1c326d286e3', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£42.96', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£42.96', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/a3/9e/a39e7c5c9fc61c2ae0f81116aa8cbb0e.jpg'})

From private brain EEG facilities to remote monasteries in Tibet, through radioactive brain scans, blood chemistry work, nervous system testing, and more, he explored traditional and alternative technologies to reach his physical and mental prime.

It was a time of creativity unparalleled in history before or since, from science to the arts, from philosophy to politics. Acclaimed philosopher and historian A.C. Grayling points to three primary factors that led to the rise of vernacular (popular) languages in philosophy, theology, science, and literature; the rise of the individual as a general and not merely an aristocratic type; and the invention and application of instruments and measurement in the study of the natural world.Grayling vividly reconstructs this unprecedented era and breathes new life into the major figures of the seventeenth century intelligentsia who span literature, music, science, art, and philosophy--Shakespeare, Monteverdi, Galileo, Rembrandt, Locke, Newton, Descartes, Vermeer, Hobbes, Milton, and Cervantes, among many more. During this century, a fundamentally new way of perceiving the world emerged as reason rose to prominence over tradition, and the rights of the individual took center stage in philosophy and politics, a paradigmatic shift that would define Western thought for centuries to come. ...more\n', 'rating': 'One', 'availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'category': 'History', 'product_info': {'UPC': 'a3d2a4250807f1e9', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£19.73', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£19.73', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/2e/65/2e654066306042f4c462ba4d048650d9.jpg'})

But w From Katherine Newman, award-winning author of No Shame in My Game, and sociologist Hella Winston, a sharp and irrefutable call to reenergize this nation's long-neglected system of vocational trainingAfter decades of off-shoring and downsizing that have left blue collar workers obsolete and stranded, the United States is now on the verge of an industrial renaissance. But we don't have a skilled enough labor pool to fill the positions that will be created, which are in many cases technically demanding and require specialized skills. A decades-long series of idealistic educational policies with the expressed goal of getting every student to go to college has left a generation of potential workers out of the system. Touted as a progressive, egalitarian institution providing opportunity even to those with the greatest need, the American secondary school system has in fact deepened existing inequalities.We can do better, argue acclaimed sociologists Katherine Newman and Hella Winston. Taking a page from the successful experience of countries like Germany and Austria, where youth unemployment is a mere 7%, they call for a radical reevaluation of the idea of vocational training, long discredited as an instrument of tracking. The United States can prepare a new, high-performance labor force if we revamp our school system to value industry apprenticeship and rigorous technical education. By doing so, we will not only be able to meet the growing demand for skilled employees in dozens of sectors where employers decry the absence of well trained workers -- we will make the American Dream accessible to all. ...more\n", 'rating': 'Two', 'availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'category': 'Nonfiction', 'product_info': {'UPC': 'd7310206583a54b6', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£19.83', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£19.83', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/2c/d2/2cd2b814b8a8cd3a49895cbd13a8b1f4.jpg'})

If you wanted to get literal, it is about an inner city boy, Sinclair, who discovers a pair of discarded angel wings. With these wings, Sinclair flies around the city and gets into adventures." - Farel Dalrymple, series creator From Publishers Weekly: Collecting the first five issues of Dalrymple\'s acclaimed comic book series Pop Gun War, this book provides a capsule look at Dalrymple\'s vision of urban fantasy. Set in New York, his stories follow characters with wings, talking fish, giants, dwarves and other fantastical acquaintances and ideas. At the center of it all is a boy named Sinclair, who acquires a set of wings when a tattooed, disgruntled angel pays to have them cut off. Sinclair, a lonely kid prone to bowties and being teased, sets off on a series of encounters across the city. His older sister, a singer in a rock band, is an inspiration and worry; a homeless man of unknown powers and origins joins him; and a band of youths pursue him. Dalrymple renders this gang of eccentrics and mystics in a loose but realistic pen and ink style highly dynamic and tailor-made for depicting New York\'s teeming city streets. He has a flair for the dramatic as well scenes of Sinclair flying, or of a giant walking the streets, are genuinely affecting, while seeming completely natural and brings to life a subtle kind of cartoon surrealism. The story meanders a bit, and it\'s not always clear where it\'s headed, but the fun of Pop Gun War is in its vivid characters and details.

Enthralled by its windswept beauty, they soon were the proud owners of a near-derelict croft house--a farmer\'s stone cottage--on "a small acre" of land. Mary assumed duties as the island\'s district nurse. Call the Nurse is her account of the enchanted years she and her family spent there, coming to know its folk as both patients and friends.In anecdotes that are by turns funny, sad, moving, and tragic, she recalls them all, the crofters and their laird, the boatmen and tradesmen, young lovers and forbidding churchmen. Against the old-fashioned island culture and the grandeur of mountain and sea unfold indelible stories: a young woman carried through snow for airlift to the hospital; a rescue by boat; the marriage of a gentle giant and the island beauty; a ghostly encounter; the shocking discovery of a woman in chains; the flames of a heather fire at night; an unexploded bomb from World War II; and the joyful, tipsy celebration of a ceilidh. Gaelic fortitude meets a nurse\'s compassion in these wonderful true stories from rural Scotland. ...more\n', 'rating': 'Five', 'availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'category': 'Nonfiction', 'product_info': {'UPC': 'bee3672891cca906', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£29.14', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£29.14', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (16 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/c5/f2/c5f2361aab546bc7f851cf93aec94ca3.jpg'})

We feel unqualified to do Godâ\x80\x99s work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good.

Because true peace and confidence come not from worldly perfection but from acceptance: Godâ\x80\x99s acceptance of you, your acceptance of yourself, and your acceptance of Godâ\x80\x99s process of change.This is a book about understanding your identity in light of who God is. Itâ\x80\x99s a book about coming to terms with the good, the bad, and the unmentionable in your life and learning to let God use you. Itâ\x80\x99s about charging into the gap between your present and your hopes and meeting God there. After all, God canâ\x80\x99t bless who you pretend to be. But he longs to bless who you really are; a flawed and broken person. Good thing for us that God is in the business of using broken people to do big things. Being Unqualified Is Godâ\x80\x99s Favorite QualificationOur culture tells us that the answer to our failures is to fix them. The solution to our weaknesses is to hide them. The secret to our success is to appear as flawless as possible. But Godâ\x80\x99s qualifying system is different than the worldâ\x80\x99s. So is his view of our weaknesses, our purpose, and our true selves.In (Un)Qualified, Steven Furtick explores who God is as the great â\x80\x9cI AM,â\x80\x9d and then helps us discover our own identity. Delving into the story of Jacob, Furtick invites us to acknowledge our weaknesses and ask God to work through them.The truth is, God has created us to be more, to accomplish more, and to love life more than we ever thought possible. But to become who he has called us to be, we must embrace who we are right now. (Un)Qualified equips us to face obstacles and failures without losing a sense of purpose.

We might not realize the ways our hearts are being taught to love rival gods instead of the One for whom we were made. Smith helps readers recognize the formative power of culture and the transformative possibilities of Christian practices. He explains that worship is the "imagination station" that incubates our loves and longings so that our cultural endeavors are indexed toward God and his kingdom. This is why the church and worshiping in a local community of believers should be the hub and heart of Christian formation and discipleship.Following the publication of his influential work Desiring the Kingdom, Smith received numerous requests from pastors and leaders for a more accessible version of that book\'s content. No mere abridgment, this new book draws on years of Smith\'s popular presentations on the ideas presented in Desiring the Kingdom to offer a fresh, bottom-up rearticulation. The author creatively uses film, literature, and music illustrations to engage readers and includes material on marriage, family, youth ministry, and faith and work.

Among them: James Bennett, a synesthetic art critic for The New York Times whose unlikely condition enables him to describe art in profound, magical ways, and Raul Engales, an exiled Argentinian painter running from his past and the Dirty War that has enveloped his country. As the two men ascend in the downtown arts scene, dual tragedies strike, and each is faced with a loss that acutely affects his relationship to life and to art. It is not until they are inadvertently brought together by Lucy Olliasonâ\x80\x94a small town beauty and Raulâ\x80\x99s museâ\x80\x94and a young orphan boy sent mysteriously from Buenos Aires, that James and Raul are able to rediscover some semblance of what theyâ\x80\x99ve lost.As inventive as Jennifer Egan's A Visit From The Goon Squad and as sweeping as Meg Wolitzer's The Interestings, Tuesday Nights in 1980 boldly renders a complex moment when the meaning and nature of art is being all but upended, and New York City as a whole is reinventing itself. In risk-taking prose that is as powerful as it is playful, Molly Prentiss deftly explores the need for beauty, community, creation, and love in an ever-changing urban landscape. ...more\n", 'rating': 'Two', 'availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'category': 'Fiction', 'product_info': {'UPC': 'b8736690cf263a3c', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£21.04', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£21.04', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/a3/ad/a3ade5edecde67449329c1ebb016c049.jpg'})

Like their acclaimed bestseller George Washington's Secret Six, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates sheds new light on a vitally important episode that has been forgotten by most Americans. Â\xa0 Only weeks after President Jefferson's inauguration in 1801, he decided to confront the Tripoli pirates who had been kidnapping American ships and sailors, among other outrageous acts. Though inclined toward diplomacy, Jefferson sent warships to blockade Tripoli and protect American shipping, and then escalated to all-out war against the Barbary states. Â\xa0 The tiny American flotillaâ\x80\x94with three frigates representing half of the U.S. Navyâ\x80\x99s top-of-the-line shipsâ\x80\x94had some success in blockading the Barbary coast. But that success came to an end when the USSÂ\xa0PhiladelphiaÂ\xa0ran aground in Tripoli harbor and was captured. Kilmeade and Yaeger recount the dramatic story of a young American sailor, Stephen Decatur, who snuck into the harbor, boarded theÂ\xa0Philadelphia,Â\xa0and set her on fire before escaping amid a torrent of enemy gunfire. Â\xa0 Another amazing story is that of William Eatonâ\x80\x99s daring attack on the port city of Derna. He led a detachment of Marines on a 500-mile trek across the desert to surprise the port. His strategy worked, and an American flag was raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time. Â\xa0 Â\xa0 Few remember Decatur and Eaton today, but their legacy inspired the opening of theÂ\xa0Marine Corps Hymn: â\x80\x9cFrom the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we fight our countryâ\x80\x99s battles in the air, on land, and sea.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates tells a dramatic story of bravery, diplomacy, and battle on the high seas, and honors some of Americaâ\x80\x99s forgotten heroes.Â\xa0 ...more\n", 'rating': 'One', 'availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'category': 'History', 'product_info': {'UPC': 'de3f25248ba0789f', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£59.64', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£59.64', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/77/79/777988a85de2269905bd8c2070a3cf58.jpg'})

At the time, only three percent of Americans were online. It took a decade for AOL to achieve mainstream success, and there were many near-death experiences and back-to-the-wall pivots. AOL became the top performing company of the 1990s, and at its peak more than half of all consumer Internet traffic in the United States ran through the service. After Case engineered AOLâ\x80\x99s merger with Time Warner and he became Chairman of the combined business, Case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world. In The Third Wave, which pays homage to the work of the futurist Alvin Toffler (from whom Case has borrowed the title, and whose work inspired him as a young man), Case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur, an investor, a philanthropist, and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies. We are entering, as Case explains, a new paradigm called the â\x80\x9cThird Waveâ\x80\x9d of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leverage the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, weâ\x80\x99re entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major â\x80\x9creal worldâ\x80\x9d sectors like health, education, transportation, energy, and foodâ\x80\x94and in the process change the way we live our daily lives. But success in the Third Wave will require a different skill set, and Case outlines the path forward.The Third Wave is part memoir, part manifesto, and part playbook for the future. With passion and clarity, Case explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies (a growing number of which, he argues, will not be based in Silicon Valley) will have to rethink their relationships with customers, with competitors, and with governments; and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategiesâ\x80\x94and how all of us can make sense of this changing digital age. ...more\n', 'rating': 'Five', 'availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'category': 'Business', 'product_info': {'UPC': '3bebf34ee9330cbd', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£12.61', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£12.61', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/0f/76/0f76b00ea914ced1822d8ac3480c485f.jpg'})

To one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore\'s dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn\'tâ\x80\x94which mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore\'s dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance. The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. At the same time we\'re realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment. The Omnivore\'s Dilemma is bestselling author Michael Pollan\'s brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America. Pollan has divided The Omnivore\'s Dilemma into three parts, one for each of the food chains that sustain us: industrialized food, alternative or "organic" food, and food people obtain by dint of their own hunting, gathering, or gardening. Pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up to the table, emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on. He concludes each section by sitting down to a mealâ\x80\x94at McDonald\'s, at home with his family sharing a dinner from Whole Foods, and in a revolutionary "beyond organic" farm in Virginia. For each meal he traces the provenance of everything consumed, revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological inheritance. We are indeed what we eat-and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world. The Omnivore\'s Dilemma is a long-overdue book and one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet momentous as What shall we have for dinner?A few facts and figures from The Omnivore\'s Dilemma:Of the 38 ingredients it takes to make a McNugget, there are at least 13 that are derived from corn. 45 different menu items at Mcdonaldâ\x80\x99s are made from corn. One in every three American children eats fast food every day. One in every five American meals today is eaten in the car. The food industry burns nearly a fifth of all the petroleum consumed in the United Statesâ\x80\x94more than we burn with our cars and more than any other industry consumes. It takes ten calories of fossil fuel energy to deliver one calorie of food energy to an American plate. A single strawberry contains about five calories. To get that strawberry from a field in California to a plate on the east coast requires 435 calories of energy. Industrial fertilizer and industrial pesticides both owe their existence to the conversion of the World War II munitions industry to civilian usesâ\x80\x94nerve gases became pesticides, and ammonium nitrate explosives became nitrogen fertilizers. ... ...more\n', 'rating': 'Two', 'availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'category': 'Nonfiction', 'product_info': {'UPC': '209adad1015af86f', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£38.21', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£38.21', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/3d/9d/3d9d46815a4be5e5e6f5e641d8268961.jpg'})

The apartment building in which the brutal crimes took place was already rundown, and in their aftermath a consensus developed in the community that it should be destroyed. It was a place, neighbors felt, that was plagued by spiritual cancer. In 2008, journalist Laura Tillman covered the story for The Brownsville Herald. The questions it raised haunted her, particularly one asked by the sole member of the cityâ\x80\x99s Heritage Council to oppose demolition: is there any such thing as an evil building? Her investigation took her far beyond that question, revealing the nature of the toll that the crime exacted on a city already wracked with poverty. It sprawled into a six-year inquiry into the larger significance of such acts, ones so difficult to imagine or explain that their perpetrators are often dismissed as monsters alien to humanity. With meticulous attention and stunning compassion, Tillman surveyed those surrounding the crimes, speaking with the lawyers who tried the case, the familyâ\x80\x99s neighbors and relatives and teachers, even one of the murderers: John Allen Rubio himself, whom she corresponded with for years and ultimately met in person. The result is a brilliant exploration of some of our ageâ\x80\x99s most important social issues, from poverty to mental illness to the death penalty, and a beautiful, profound meditation on the truly human forces that drive them.

InThe Genius of Birds, Birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures. In fact, according to revolutionary new research, some birds rival primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence.Â\xa0 Like humans, many birds have enormous brains relative to their size. Although small, bird brains are packed with neurons that allow them to punch well above their weight. InÂ\xa0The Genius of Birds, acclaimed author Jennifer Ackerman explores the newly discovered brilliance of birds and how it came about. As she travels around the world to the most cutting-edge frontiers of researchâ\x80\x94 the distant laboratories of Barbados and New Caledonia, the great tit communities of the United Kingdom and the bowerbird habitats of Australia, the ravaged mid-Atlantic coast after Hurricane Sandy and the warming mountains of central Virginia and the western statesâ\x80\x94Ackerman not only tells the story of the recently uncovered genius of birds but also delves deeply into the latest findings about the bird brain itself that are revolutionizing our view of what it means to be intelligent.Consider, as Ackerman does, the Clarkâ\x80\x99s nutcracker, a bird that can hide as many as 30,000 seeds over dozens of square miles and remember where it put them several months later; the mockingbirds and thrashers, species that can store 200 to 2,000 different songs in a brain a thousand times smaller than ours; the well-known pigeon, which knows where itâ\x80\x99s going, even thousands of miles from familiar territory; and the New Caledonian crow, an impressive bird that makes its own tools. But beyond highlighting how birds use their unique genius in technical ways, Ackerman points out the impressive social smarts of birds. They deceive and manipulate. They eavesdrop. They display a strong sense of fairness. They give gifts. They play keep-away and tug-of-war. They tease. They share. They cultivate social networks. They vie for status. They kiss to console one another. They teach their young. They blackmail their parents. They alert one another to danger. They summon witnesses to the death of a peer. They may even grieve. This elegant scientific investigation and travelogue weaves personal anecdotes with fascinating science. Ackerman delivers an extraordinary story that will both give readers a new appreciation for the exceptional talents of birds and let them discover what birds can reveal about our changing world. Incredibly informative and beautifully written,Â\xa0The Genius of BirdsÂ\xa0richly celebrates the triumphs of these surprising and fiercely intelligent creatures. ...more\n', 'rating': 'One', 'availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'category': 'Nonfiction', 'product_info': {'UPC': '42d0d7c92b75fc1c', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£17.24', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£17.24', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/2e/52/2e52982210cbc8dffe414cab72b52e38.jpg'})

With technology, our abilities to connectÂ\xa0with and sort through these options are staggering.Â\xa0So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time.Â\xa0â\x80\x9cWhy did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0â\x80\x9cShould I go out with this girl even though sheÂ\xa0listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods?Â\xa0Combos?!â\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cMy girlfriend just got a message fromÂ\xa0some dude named Nathan.

In a shortÂ\xa0period of time, the whole culture of finding loveÂ\xa0has changed dramatically. A few decades ago,Â\xa0people would find a decent person who lived inÂ\xa0their neighborhood. Their families would meetÂ\xa0and, after deciding neither party seemed like aÂ\xa0murderer, they would get married and soon haveÂ\xa0a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today,Â\xa0people marry later than ever and spend years ofÂ\xa0their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, aÂ\xa0soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming hisÂ\xa0comic insight at modern romance, but for ModernÂ\xa0Romance, the book, he decided he needed to takeÂ\xa0things to another level. He teamed up with NYUÂ\xa0sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massiveÂ\xa0research project, including hundreds of interviewsÂ\xa0and focus groups conducted everywhere fromÂ\xa0Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzedÂ\xa0behavioral data and surveys and created their ownÂ\xa0online research forum on Reddit, which drewÂ\xa0thousands of messages. They enlisted the worldâ\x80\x99sÂ\xa0leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, HelenÂ\xa0Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, SherryÂ\xa0Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike anyÂ\xa0social science or humor book weâ\x80\x99ve seen before.In Modern Romance, Ansari combines hisÂ\xa0irreverent humor with cutting-edge social scienceÂ\xa0to give us an unforgettable tour of our newÂ\xa0romantic world. ...more\n', 'rating': 'Five', 'availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'category': 'Add a comment', 'product_info': {'UPC': 'caf4fe9311f1dc59', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£28.26', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£28.26', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/78/cb/78cb28a3e8804131e8e0c3f7b8deb2fc.jpg'})

And yet John Quincy fell in love with her, almost despite himself. Their often tempestuous but deeply close marriage lasted half a century.Â\xa0 They lived in Prussia, Massachusetts, Washington, Russia, and England, at royal courts, on farms, in cities, and in the White House. Louisa saw more of Europe and America than nearly any other woman of her time. But wherever she lived, she was always pressing her nose against the glass, not quite sure whether she was looking in or out. The other members of the Adams family could take their identity for grantedâ\x80\x94they were Adamses; they were Americansâ\x80\x94but she had to invent her own. The story of Louisa Catherine Adams is one of a woman who forged a sense of self. As the country her husband led found its place in the world, she found a voice. That voice resonates still.Â\xa0 In this deeply felt biography, the talented journalist and historian Louisa Thomas finally gives Louisa Catherine Adams's full extraordinary life its due. An intimate portrait of a remarkable woman, a complicated marriage, and a pivotal historical moment, Louisa Thomas's biography is a masterful work from an elegant storyteller. ...more\n", 'rating': 'Two', 'availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'category': 'Biography', 'product_info': {'UPC': 'd69dd8dac66f9f84', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£16.85', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£16.85', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/ec/2a/ec2a7df6fdafc7e6f97b6c6da7980584.jpg'})

Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others) explains in his paradigm-shattering book Drive, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business doesâ\x80\x94and how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the wrong way to motivate people for today's challenges. In Drive, he reveals the three elements of true motivation:*Autonomyâ\x80\x94the desire to direct our own lives*Masteryâ\x80\x94the urge to get better and better at something that matters*Purposeâ\x80\x94the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselvesAlong the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.Drive is bursting with big ideasâ\x80\x94the rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live. ...more\n", 'rating': 'Four', 'availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'category': 'Default', 'product_info': {'UPC': '6ffb36aaeff1c81e', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£34.95', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£34.95', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/e9/48/e948a672efe721b408c8dd1f1f3ec529.jpg'})

The heart of her work on her national public radio program and podcast,Â\xa0On Being, has been to shine a light on people whose insights kindle in us a sense of wonder and courage. Scientists in a variety of fields; theologians from an array of faiths; poets, activists, and many others have all opened themselves up to Tippett's compassionate yet searching conversation. Â\xa0 InÂ\xa0Becoming Wise, Tippett distills the insights she has gleaned from this luminous conversation in its many dimensions into a coherent narrative journey, over time and from mind to mind. The book is a master class in living, curated by Tippett and accompanied by a delightfully ecumenical dream team of teaching faculty. Â\xa0 The open questions and challenges of our time are intimate and civilizational all at once, Tippett says â\x80\x93 definitions of when life begins and when death happens, of the meaning of community and family and identity, of our relationships to technology and through technology. The wisdom we seek emerges through the raw materials of the everyday. And the enduring question of what it means to be human has now become inextricable from the question of who we are to each other. Â\xa0 This book offers a grounded and fiercely hopeful vision of humanity for this century â\x80\x93 of personal growth but also renewed public life and human spiritual evolution. It insists on the possibility of a common life for this century marked by resilience and redemption, with beauty as a core moral value and civility and love as muscular practice. Krista Tippett's great gift, in her work and in Becoming Wise, is to avoid reductive simplifications but still find the golden threads that weave people and ideas together into a shimmering braid. Â\xa0 One powerful common denominator of the lessons imparted to Tippett is the gift of presence, of the exhilaration of engagement with life for its own sake, not as a means to an end. But presence does not mean passivity or acceptance of the status quo. Indeed Tippett and her teachers are people whose work meets, and often drives, powerful forces of change alive in the world today. In the end, perhaps the greatest blessing conveyed by the lessons of spiritual genius Tippett harvests inÂ\xa0Becoming WiseÂ\xa0is the strength to meet the world where it really is, and then to make it better. ...more\n", 'rating': 'Two', 'availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'category': 'Nonfiction', 'product_info': {'UPC': '919e7cb2269a25d2', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£27.43', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£27.43', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/33/65/3365a493bba6856798437c3e341a1e5d.jpg'})

Together with inker Klaus Janson and colorist Lynn Varley, writer/artist Frank Miller completely reinvents the legend of Batman in his saga of a near-future Gotham City gone to rot, ten years after the Dark Knight's retirement. Crime runs rampant in the streets, and the man who was Batman is still tortured by the memories of his parents' murders. As civil society crumbles around him, Bruce Wayne's long-suppressed vigilante side finally breaks free of its self-imposed shackles. The Dark Knight returns in a blaze of fury, taking on a whole new generation of criminals and matching their level of violence. He is soon joined by this generation's Robin â\x80\x94 a girl named Carrie Kelley, who proves to be just as invaluable as her predecessors.But can Batman and Robin deal with the threat posed by their deadliest enemies, after years of incarceration have made them into perfect psychopaths? And more important, can anyone survive the coming fallout of an undeclared war between the superpowers - or a clash of what were once the world's greatest superheroes?Over fifteen years after its debut, 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns' remains an undisputed classic and one of the most influential stories ever told in the comics medium.Collecting BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS #1-4 ...more\n", 'rating': 'Five', 'availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'category': 'Sequential Art', 'product_info': {'UPC': '47271d8e08b5d31c', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£15.38', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£15.38', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (15 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/1e/38/1e381319aaf7cf69c27a5171520d53fe.jpg'})

Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotryâ\x80\x94a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy.Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious â\x80\x9cKing of the Jewsâ\x80\x9d whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity.Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of Nazarethâ\x80\x99s life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion. ...more\n', 'rating': 'Three', 'availability': 'In stock (14 available)', 'category': 'History', 'product_info': {'UPC': 'dd5bfa6cc2c0ecc3', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£24.70', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£24.70', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (14 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/21/da/21dab5c065cfcde1bad7ded16a753102.jpg'})

Its core contention is that American conservatism and the Republican Party took a wrong turn when they adopted Barry Goldwaterâ\x80\x99s worldview during and after the 1964 campaign. The radicalism of todayâ\x80\x99s conservatism is not the product of the Tea Party, Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne writes. The Tea Partiers are the true heirs to Goldwater ideology. The purity movement did more than drive moderates out of the Republican Partyâ\x80\x94it beat back alternative definitions of conservatism.Since 1968, no conservative administrationâ\x80\x94not Nixon not Reagan not two Bushesâ\x80\x94could live up to the rhetoric rooted in the Goldwater movement that began to reshape American politics fifty years ago. The collapse of the Nixon presidency led to the rise of Ronald Reagan, the defeat of George H.W. Bush, to Newt Gingrichâ\x80\x99s revolution. Bush initially undertook a partial modernization, preaching â\x80\x9ccompassionate conservatismâ\x80\x9d and a â\x80\x9cFourth Wayâ\x80\x9d to Clintonâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9cThird Way.â\x80\x9d Conservatives quickly defined him as an advocate of â\x80\x9cbig governmentâ\x80\x9d and not conservative enough on spending, immigration, education, and Medicare. A return to the true faith was the only prescription on order. The result was the Tea Party, which Dionne says, was as much a reaction to Bush as to Obama.The state of the Republican party, controlled by the strictest base, is diminished, Dionne writes. It has become white and older in a country that is no longer that. It needs to come back to life for its own health and that of the countryâ\x80\x99s, and in Why the Right Went Wrong, he explains how. ...more\n", 'rating': 'Four', 'availability': 'In stock (14 available)', 'category': 'Politics', 'product_info': {'UPC': '2b5054a4192e9b06', 'Product Type': 'Books', 'Price (excl. tax)': 'Â£52.65', 'Price (incl. tax)': 'Â£52.65', 'Tax': 'Â£0.00', 'Availability': 'In stock (14 available)', 'Number of reviews': '0'}, 'image_url': 'http://books.toscrape.com//media/cache/cd/64/cd64ccda3382d62fea8167eaadd6c9a0.jpg'})
